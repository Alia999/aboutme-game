 # Reflections and Comments
 this is a guessing game

How did this go, overall? it was hard
What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far? why to make console then comment it and how it does not hurt the rest of the code
How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment? I did it first time with 2 h then it was not running any more . I spent 2 h looking for the reason . after that I wrote a new code.
